  <p>
    A playground backend where you can save prompts, send them to models via MCP, and receive responses, using a universal protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is useful for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Test models (Claude, Mistral, GPT) in a standard way without depending on each SDK.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a versioned and saved system of your prompts as .json files ready to share, test, send.
    </li>
    <li>
      Build UIs or flows on top of MCP easily, because this backend is flexible and dockerizable.
    </li>
  </ul>
