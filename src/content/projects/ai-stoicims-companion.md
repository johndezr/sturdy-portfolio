  <p>
    I built an AI chat companion inspired by Plato's Symposium for philosophy enthusiasts to engage in meaningful conversations about love, wisdom, and human nature. The system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide personalized and context-aware conversations, integrating Replicate for AI model inference, Pinecone for conversation memory and context storage, and Redis for real-time chat state management and caching.
