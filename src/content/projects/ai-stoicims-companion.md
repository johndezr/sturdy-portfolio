  <p>
    The challenge here has been to understand how the communication with the google api works to create a knowledge base in the jupyter notebook. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea is to be able to import from different sources files and attach them to jupyter notebook via API, taking into consideration the user authentication in google, you can select a series of files from your preferred folder in google drive to index it in the app, this does not affect your files in google drive, once indexed in the app, you can start the creation of your knowledge base to your Jupyter Notebook.

    Have a look to the whole design and code process pressing the github icon.
