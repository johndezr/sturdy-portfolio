          A brief of <span class="text-muted-foreground ml-2">who I am</span>
        </h2>

        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-muted-foreground">
            My interest in software development was born from a mix between curiosity and desire to
            build useful things.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted-foreground text-base/6">
            Today I design before I write a line of code. I like to think about architecture, about
            users, about how all the pieces fit together. It's not just about making it work, it's
            about making sense to whoever uses it... and whoever maintains it afterwards.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted-foreground text-base/6">
            Outside of the keyboard, my curiosity is still active: I explore surfing, country music,
            and how creative disciplines influence the way we solve problems. I'm interested in how
            we learn, how we collaborate, and how we can best document that process.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted-foreground text-base/6">
            I'm always learning, always evolving, and always looking for the next exciting project
            to tackle. ðŸš€
